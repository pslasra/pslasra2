                <p>A vision statement, or simply a vision, is a public declaration that schools or other educational organizations use to describe their high-level goals for the future—what they hope to achieve if they successfully fulfill their organizational purpose or mission."School Name will foster curiosity to encourage a deep understanding of the world and our role in it." This example clearly describes the school's purpose: to encourage students to gain a deep understanding of the world and their role in it.“Our vision is to create a better everyday life for many people.” That's aspirational, short and to the point. More than that, it sets the tone for the company and makes it clear that they're in the market to offer low-priced good furnishings that suit everyone's lifestyle.</p>
