                <p>The teachers of Pratmic Vidyalaya lasra said that we always try that give our 100% focus to our student to perform better than the other school and also private schools. The Principal and teacher said that "Koi bhi child or student ashichit n rhe kyoki hamare vidyalaya me adhikansh wahi bacche hai jo ki private school ki fee ko afford nhi kar sakte hai. Hamari kosis yahi rahti hai ki hum apne baccho ko kis tarah se gyan batten ki wo private school ke baccho ko bhi beat kar de, bus isiliye hum baccho ko theory ke saath-saath practical gyan bhi dete hai taki vo topic unhe acche se samajh me aa jaye A teacher has to stand by their students to help them overcome these challenges. Here, the primary job is to be empathetic with the students. Show care and nurture students, pay extra attention, be their best pals, show confidence to build the best relationship and extract the best out of them."</p>
